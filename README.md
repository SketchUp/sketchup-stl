# Welcome to SketchUp-STL

A SketchUp Ruby Extension that adds STL (STereoLithography) file format
import and export.

3D printing is awesome, and the STL format has emerged as a standard way to share printable 3D models. To support this community, SketchUp has gathered a couple of Ruby plugins and packaged them into a single Extension. Stay tuned! This is our first foray into Open Source, an experiment we hope to repeat.

## Installing

The latest and greatest is available as an RBZ file. Download the file from this url:

https://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-stl/raw/master/sketchup-stl-1.0.0.rbz

Then inside SketchUp, select Window > Preferences (Microsoft Windows) or SketchUp > Preferences (Mac OS X) > Extensions > Install Extension and select the RBZ file you just downloaded. Voila! SketchUp installs the extension. You'll find a new import type under File > Import and a File > Export STL menu option as well.
