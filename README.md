# Welcome to SketchUp-STL

A SketchUp Ruby Extension that adds STL (STereoLithography) file format
import and export.

3D printing is awesome, and the STL format has emerged as a standard way to share printable 3D models. To support this community, SketchUp has gathered a couple of Ruby plugins and packaged them into a single Extension. Stay tuned! This is our first foray into Open Source, an experiment we hope to repeat.

## Installing

The latest and greatest is available as an RBZ file. Download the file from this URL:

http://extensions.sketchup.com/content/sketchup-stl

Then inside SketchUp, select `Window` → `Preferences` (Microsoft Windows) or `SketchUp` → `Preferences` (Mac OS X) → `Extensions` → `Install Extension` and select the RBZ file you just downloaded. Voila! SketchUp installs the extension. You'll find a new import type under `File` → `Import` and a `File` → `Export STL` menu option as well.
